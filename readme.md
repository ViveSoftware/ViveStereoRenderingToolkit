## Introduction

- Vive Stereo Rendering Toolkit provides drag-and-drop components for developers to create stereoscopic rendering effects in a few minutes. 
- With this toolkit, effects such as mirrors or portal doors can be easily achieved in your VR application.

## System Requirements

1. Unity 5.5.0 or higher.

2. Appropriate SDK for target VR devices
 - Vive or other SteamVR-compatible HMDs: SteamVR Unity plugin, version 1.2.0 or higher
 - Vive Focus: WaveVR plugin, version 2.0.13 or higher
 - Oculus Rift: OVR plugin, version 1.20.0 or higher

3. **To run the examples, add camera rig prefabs from respective platform SDKs**
 - Vive or other SteamVR-compatible HMDs: no need to modify.
 - Vive Focus: add **WaveVR** from "WaveVR/Prefabs" to the scenes; remember to expand the camera rig.
 - Oculus Rift: add **OVRCameraRig** from "OVR/Prefabs" to the scenes.
